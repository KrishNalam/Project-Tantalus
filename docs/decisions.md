# Decision log (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records: short, dated notes on **what was decided and why**, plus
the alternatives rejected. Maintained by Claude, and an entry is only added **after** the
decision is actually implemented in the repo — never ahead of the code.

Format per entry: `### YYYY-MM-DD — <title>` then **Decision / Why / Rejected**.

### 2026-09-30 — Use uv for dependency management and packaging

**Decision:** Manage the project with [uv] (Python 3.12 pinned via `.python-version`);
add deps with `uv add`, run with `uv run`. Build backend is `uv_build`.
**Why:** Fast, reproducible installs with a committed `uv.lock`; single tool for envs,
deps, and running.
**Rejected:** plain `pip`/`venv` (no lockfile by default), Poetry/conda (heavier).
